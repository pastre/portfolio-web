I then started to design screens on Sketch to properly preview the app. Having designed the app, I jumped into Xcode and started to program the app. Having developed an MVP, I interviwed some collegues and figured out that being able to quickly export to macOS was an important thing, I developed a macOS app that syncs with the palettes generated on the app.  With the app published on the App Store, I did some usability tests to understand how some people interact with the app, and to get some insights about how to improve it and how to monetize it. Since then, I am developing a version with some freemium features and improving the app. "] ,

With enough inspiration, I was able to create the app's concept, which is basically me telling stories about myself. With all that in mind, I prototyped some screens on Sketch and tried to get a little crazy with the interactions. With that done, I started coding,  which was pretty hard, since I wanted to use the native Memoji library, which is private. After playing a little with Obj-C to try and dynamically load the lib and reverse engineer it, I discovered that Memojis are stored in a private database, which, due to sandbox, my app doesn't have permission to access. I then recorded some Memoji videos and played them randomly using AVFoundation, which was pretty fun, because I needed to perfectly record transitions that I'm still working on getting perfect. I also learned a lot about animations and custom view controller transitions"] ,

We decided to do a game based on Snake VS Blocks, but with some extra challenges. With a very strong reference, I started to work on procedural level generation, game mechanics, progression and balancing. This was the third game I've ever made, and I'm thankful for the people around me for helping me better understand how deep can game development go. Having so many experts around me, I did a few pair programmings to get some concepts right, and, with the game in a publishable state, I designed the UI. Then, my communications friend took some time to teach me about marketing, and that experience was pretty fun and de-mistifyed a lot about how advertising works"

We researched and interviewed people to better understand what they think and how do they expect to interact with .space, and started developing. I did some pair programming with the other developer to create a model that we would share, developed the Augmented Reality feature using ARKit and SceneKit, imported the models that my friend created, pair programmed with my other friend to implement the UI using layout constraints. It was an awesome experiment, since I always wanted to learn AR. "

In Relibox, I developed flow diagrams, created personas, created wireframes and screens. My group and I also did UX research, interviews, cultural probes and focal groups. This project really opened my eyes about what does it mean to be a designer, and it is a privillege to truly understand and empathise with the other side of mobile development"

Then, we interviewed some people to better understand the product we wanted to develop, and we decided to work on an idle multplayer game. We, then, distributed our efforts into microsservices: logical model, front-end, firebase and game balancing. The first thing I did was to co-create and explain a shared data model for my fellow developers, so that everyone could start coding from the same ground. Then, using a moodboard a friend created, I designed a low fidelity wireframe that was used as a base for the rest of the project. Then, I started to develop local microsservices, working mainly on data manipulation and integrity, as the other developer was working on UI and firebase sync. Since we were using a solid model, the integration between the areas was really straight-forward. We then started to work on minigames. In one of the games, we trained a neural network to recognize doodles and challenge the user to draw an emoji. In another, we used our own source code and challenge the user to tap as fast as he can to work faster. The last game is strongly inspired by flappy bird, and we used SpriteKit "

Hor치riosPUCPR was never published on the App Store, but we had forms open for anyone to join the beta, and had around 500 candidates to test it"

He started by fetching references and creating a moodboard about how he wanted the site to look like. Then, he started it using ReactJS, but figured out he wanted to learn about some vanilla web development, and switched over to HTML, CSS and Javascript."

			"<b>Story: </b> dod is a startup based in Curitiba, Brazil, which I worked on for a year and 2 months. Over there, I started by modeling the database, developing the backend and assisting in the front end. After a while, I changed to the production team, where I proposed a microservices architecture running on the cloud, and worked on integrating all services using design patterns. From those services, I developed the Database, which was queried by the frontend; Camera Monitor, which accessed data from costumers; Health Monitor, which logs performance and errors; Showroom, which processed our information into a video to showcase on conferences; NNetwork Manager, which manages how images are processed to optimize GPU usage; and integrated 6 different video processing services, 4 of which use Machine Learning. Having that up and running, I started to work on optimization, and figured out that it would be too expensive to keep running neural networks on the cloud, so we pivoted and embedded the system. I developed the system's lifecycle, ported the cloud system into our hardware, worked on automatic updates, developed  services related to the hardware and user interface, and setup an automatic process for new firmware creation. After that, I started to work on another project, and studied the IEEE 802 protocol and the OSI model, specifically the media layers, to try to triangulate someone using WiFi. Due to some privacy concerns, that project was put aside, which lead me back to the production team, where I integrated a new service based on emotion recognition and implemented its visualization "
